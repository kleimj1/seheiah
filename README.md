monitoring of people living alone based on water consumption

This is actually more an academical projekt than a real life application. Seheiah ist currently very buggy and not reliable, so be very carefull and don't use it to monitor a real exposed person.

Also the code locks sometimes very ugly, because I had to write it in a very short time, its momentarily more an proto type. Some background information you find in the associated paper (in German) in directory research-project. I will improve it in next months.

Nonetheless i would be happy, if you would test it and give feedback to falko@benthinonline.de
